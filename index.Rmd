For each week's assignment, I've posted (or will have posted) one or more video tutorials and a written tutorial here. Since R is a script-based program, the written tutorials will often be sufficient, but the video tutorials may be useful to you as you begin to familiarize yourself with the RStudio interface.

## Week 1: Identify a dataset
